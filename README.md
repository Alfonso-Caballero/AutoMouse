# AutoMouse
This program automatically moves the mouse pointer and presses the Windows key to prevent the screen from automatically turning off. It has a very simple interface created with the Tkinter and Customtkinter libraries, allowing you to control the speed at which the pointer moves. It also provides the option to set a time limit to automatically stop the movement. To stop the program at any time, simply press the 'S' key on the keyboard
The file "ResizeClass" serves to automatically adjust the size of the background image based on the screen size, its not used in the final version.
